# Welcome to Kode Devs contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Any contribution you make will be reflected on our
repo.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and
merging the PR.

Read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Kode-Devs/Kode/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community
approachable and respectable.

## Getting Started

You can contribute to the project in several ways. This repo is a place to discuss and collaborate on our project! Our
small, but mighty team is maintaining this repo, to preserve our bandwidth, off-topic conversations will be closed.

### üì£ Discussions

Discussions are where we have conversations.

If you'd like help troubleshooting a PR you're working on, have a great new idea, or want to share something amazing
you've learned, join us in
[discussions](https://github.com/Kode-Devs/Kode/discussions).

### üêû Issues

Issues are used to track tasks that contributors can help with.

If you've found something that should be updated, search open issues to see if someone else has reported the same thing.
If it's something new, open an issue. We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

Also, you can scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. If you find an issue to work on, you are
welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### üõ† Pull Requests

A pull request is a way to suggest changes in our repository.

When we merge those changes, they should be deployed in our next release.

Points to remember:

- Fill the PR description with suitable information, so that reviewers can understand your changes as well as the
  purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to link PR to issue if you are solving one.
- Optionally, enable the checkbox to allow maintainer edits so the branch can be updated for a merge. Once you submit
  your PR, we will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.

### Your PR is merged!
